1. create a .bat file in your desktop/a folder you want
2. copy the script code and replace 'steam_account_username_goes_here' with your steam account username you want to login to

- first time you start the script, you might have to re-login
- create a new .bat file for each steam account you've; can't have something like "set username=steamaccount1 steamccount2"
